This project is a python implementation of Object tracking using OpenCV. OpenCV comes with eight different types of object tracking methods such as:
1. BOOSTING Tracker
2. MIL Tracker
3. KCF Tracker
4. TLD Tracker
5. MEDIANFLOW Tracker
6. MOSSE Tracker
7. CSRT Tracker

Input the tracker type to run the program.

Note: Use CSRT tracker to achieve high tracking accuracy

Requirements: Use OpenCV 3.4+ to get support for all the trackers :)
